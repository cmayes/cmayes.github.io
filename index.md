Hello!  I'm a programmer who mainly uses [Java][java] and [Scala][scala] for work and 
[Python][python] 
at home. I'm primarily [Linux][linux]-based at home (I have [Mint][mint] on 
my primary dev machine) and have used a [Mac][mac] (deploying to [RHEL][rhel] 
and [AWS][aws]) at work. I know enough shell scripting to get my launch environment 
set up but prefer Python for any serious scripting work. 

[IntelliJ IDEA][idea] is my IDE of choice. I'd previously used
[Eclipse][eclipse] since ~2003, and [Emacs][emacs] before that. I'll admit to using
[vim][vim] for most of my CLI editing, though my frustrations with modal editing
have thus far prevented me from becoming truly proficient.

I've toyed with many programming languages in the past ([Ruby][ruby], 
[Clojure][clojure], [Rust][rust], and [Fantom][fantom], among others) and have 
plans to learn many others.  My newest focus is [Kotlin][kotlin], which shows promise
as the successor to Java on the JVM. I'm an advocate for using the right tool for the 
job, so it's useful to make a periodic survey of the state of the software development world.

Here are a few of the places where I have a web presence:
