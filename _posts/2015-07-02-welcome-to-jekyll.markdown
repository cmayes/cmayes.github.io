I've created my [Github Pages][cmayes-github] site!  I will probably also redirect [cmayes.com][cmayes-com] and [cmayes.org][cmayes-org] here.

To avoid getting lost in the weeds, I'm going to leave the default layout in place; it's simple and inoffensive.  I'd like to bring my web 
development skills nearer to this decade's state of the art (90% of what I know would have worked equally well in 1998) before I try to make
any changes.  I know from painful experience that crafting a new site layout takes roughly an order of magnitude longer than I'd expect it to...
